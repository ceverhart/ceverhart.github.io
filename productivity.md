I truly believe that developing good productivity techniques allow us to get more done, and also _**enjoy our work**_. 

A lot of ink has been spilled about the evils of multi-tasking, but the problem still exists. Now we say "competing priorities", which may be better philosophically, but has it's own challenges in practice.

Distractions are all around us in work and life. Meetings, administrative tasks, phone calls, and emergencies are all part of our day. Maybe those are the nature of your work, and you enjoy that, but that's not the case for everyone.
