## About me

### Details matter (a lot) 

- Every problem/project/task gets very careful consideration regardless of size or scope

### Passion

- Whether it's implemention, continuous improvement, or ongoing monitoring; I approach every process or data challenge equally.

### Productivity

- Productivity techniques allow us to get more done, and also **enjoy our work**

### Experience

- I've handled all sorts of data over the years, and all flavors of it are interesting. 

### Learning

- Learning opportunites are endless and that's always exciting to me

### Teamwork

- There's such a wealth of knowledge in all of us. It's always rewarding to work with teammates (direct or cross-functional), as well as internal and external customers
